String Concatination and String Interpolation both methods used for Combine Strings.
In String Interpolation we used ${} symbol for Combine string for example

let name = "Deepshikha";
let surname = "Vishwakarma";

console.log(`My full name is ${name} ${surname}.`);    (we are combining two Strings using String Interpolation)

console.log("My full name is"+" "+name+" "+surname+" ."); (we are combining two Strings using String Concatination)
